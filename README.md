FlickrBrowser
=============
Hi! This is my first project on Objective C developed in the study of iPhone development course of Stanford University 
on iTunes. This is a client for tracking photos on Flickr.com. 
It allows browsing recently added photos by cities and on the map and also add them to the Favorites.
